AI coding sessions are great for development, but hard to share. Screen recordings are bulky and transcripts are hard to navigate.

**claude-replay** turns Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex CLI session logs into interactive, shareable HTML replays. The generated replay is a single self-contained HTML file with no external dependencies — you can email it, host it anywhere, or embed it in documentation.

Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex CLI store conversation transcripts as JSONL files on disk. **claude-replay** auto-detects the format and converts them into visual replays suitable for blog posts, demos, and documentation.

| Source | Transcript location |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/projects/<project>/` |
| Cursor | `~/.cursor/projects/<project>/agent-transcripts/<id>/` |
| Codex CLI | `~/.codex/sessions/<date>/` |

## Features

- Self-contained HTML output (no dependencies)
- Interactive playback with speed control
- Collapse/expand tool calls and thinking blocks (Claude's internal reasoning traces)
- Bookmarks / chapters
- Secret redaction before export
- Multiple color themes
- Terminal-style bottom-to-top scroll
- Embeddable via iframe
- Web-based editor UI for visual session editing and preview

## Use cases

claude-replay is useful for:

- **Blog posts** — show AI-assisted development sessions interactively
- **Documentation** — embed AI debugging sessions or code walkthroughs
- **Demos** — share reproducible sessions without video
- **Bug reports** — attach a replay instead of long logs
- **Teaching** — step through AI reasoning and tool usage

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g claude-replay
```

Or run directly with npx (zero install):

```bash
npx claude-replay
```

### Docker

```bash
docker run --rm -p 7331:7331 \
  -v ~/.claude/projects:/root/.claude/projects:ro \
  ghcr.io/es617/claude-replay
```

Open http://localhost:7331 for the web editor. Session directories are mounted read-only.

For CLI usage:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v ~/.claude/projects:/root/.claude/projects:ro \
  -v $(pwd):/output \
  ghcr.io/es617/claude-replay \
  /root/.claude/projects/my-project/session.jsonl -o /output/replay.html
```

## Quick start

```bash
# Launch the web editor (default)
claude-replay

# Generate a replay by session ID (auto-finds the file)
claude-replay abc123def456 -o replay.html

# Or pass the full path
claude-replay ~/.claude/projects/-Users-me-myproject/session-id.jsonl -o replay.html

# Chain multiple sessions into one replay
claude-replay session1-id session2-id -o combined.html
```

Running `claude-replay` with no arguments opens a browser-based editor that auto-discovers your Claude Code and Cursor sessions. From there you can browse, edit, preview, and export replays visually.

For CLI usage, you can pass just a session ID — claude-replay will search `~/.claude/projects/`, `~/.cursor/projects/`, and `~/.codex/sessions/` to find the matching file. Or pass the full path to a JSONL file directly.

### Cursor

Cursor transcripts are also supported — the format is auto-detected. Cursor transcripts don't include timestamps, so playback uses paced timing by default (see [Timing modes](#timing-modes)).

```bash
claude-replay ~/.cursor/projects/*/agent-transcripts/<id>/<id>.jsonl -o replay.html
```

### Codex CLI

Codex CLI (OpenAI) transcripts are also supported — the format is auto-detected. Codex tool calls (`exec_command`, `apply_patch`) are mapped to their Claude Code equivalents (`Bash`, `Edit`/`Write`) so they render with the same diff views and command previews.

```bash
claude-replay ~/.codex/sessions/2026/03/12/rollout-<id>.jsonl -o replay.html
```

## Web Editor

The default experience. Launch it by running `claude-replay` with no arguments:

```bash
claude-replay
claude-replay --port 8080
```

![Editor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/es617/claude-replay/main/docs/editor-demo.gif)

The editor provides:
- **Session browser** — auto-discovers sessions from `~/.claude/projects/`, `~/.cursor/projects/`, and `~/.codex/sessions/`, plus a folder navigator for JSONL files stored elsewhere
- **Turn editor** — include/exclude turns, edit user prompts, expand assistant blocks (read-only), add bookmarks
- **Options panel** — theme, speed, thinking/tool call toggles, redaction rules, labels
- **Live preview** — updates as you edit, renders the same output as the CLI
- **Export** — download the final HTML replay

The editor runs a local server on `127.0.0.1` (localhost only, not exposed to the network). It never modifies your original JSONL files — all edits are held in memory and only affect the exported output.

## Usage

```
claude-replay [--port N]                        Launch the web editor (default)
claude-replay <input> [input2...] [options]     Generate replay from CLI
claude-replay extract <replay.html> [-o output.jsonl] [--format jsonl|json]
```

Each `<input>` can be a `.jsonl` file path or a session ID. If it does not end in `.jsonl` and is not an existing file path, it is treated as a session ID. claude-replay searches `~/.claude/projects/`, `~/.cursor/projects/`, and `~/.codex/sessions/` for a matching session file. You can find your current session ID in Claude Code by running `/status`.

Multiple inputs are concatenated into a single replay (up to 20). When all sessions have timestamps, turns are sorted chronologically; otherwise command-line order is used. This is useful when accepting a plan creates a new session — chain the sessions to get the full story in one replay.

### Commands

#### `editor [file|session-id]`

Launches the web-based replay editor. Optionally pass a file path or session ID to auto-load it on startup. See [Web Editor](#web-editor) above.

```bash
claude-replay editor                              # empty editor
claude-replay editor ~/.claude/projects/.../session.jsonl  # auto-load file
claude-replay editor abc123                       # auto-load by session ID
```

#### `extract`

Extract the embedded turn data from a previously generated replay HTML file. Outputs JSONL by default (one turn per line, bookmarks embedded). Use `--format json` for the legacy JSON format.

```bash
claude-replay extract replay.html -o session.jsonl            # JSONL (default)
claude-replay extract replay.html -o data.json --format json  # JSON

# Round-trip: extract, then regenerate with different options
claude-replay extract replay.html -o session.jsonl
claude-replay session.jsonl -o new-replay.html --theme dracula
```

The extracted JSONL can be fed back into `claude-replay` to regenerate with different options. Bookmarks are preserved as a `bookmark` field on each turn.

### Examples

```bash
# Replay turns 5 through 15 at 2x speed
claude-replay session.jsonl --turns 5-15 --speed 2.0 -o replay.html

# Filter by time range
claude-replay session.jsonl --from "2026-02-26T02:00" --to "2026-02-26T03:00" -o replay.html

# Clean output: no thinking, no tools
claude-replay session.jsonl --no-thinking --no-tool-calls -o replay.html

# Use a different theme
claude-replay session.jsonl --theme dracula -o replay.html

# Pipe to stdout for further processing
claude-replay session.jsonl --turns 1-5 > snippet.html

# Chain multiple sessions into one replay
claude-replay abc123 def456 ghi789 -o combined.html
```

## Timing modes

The `--timing` flag controls how playback speed is derived:

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `auto` | Uses real timestamps if available, falls back to `paced` (default) |
| `real` | Uses original timestamps from the transcript |
| `paced` | Generates synthetic timing based on content length |

`paced` mode creates presentation-style timing — similar to how slides appear in a presentation or subtitles are timed in a video. Block reveal speed scales with text length. This is the default for Cursor transcripts (which have no timestamps) and can also be used with Claude Code transcripts for smoother demos:

```bash
# Use paced timing even for Claude Code transcripts
claude-replay session.jsonl --timing paced -o demo.html
```

## Player controls

The generated HTML file is a fully self-contained interactive player:

- **Play/Pause** — auto-advances through turns with block-by-block animation
- **Step forward/back** — navigate one block at a time within turns
- **Progress bar** — click to jump to any point; session timer shows elapsed/total time
- **Speed control** — 0.5x to 5x playback speed
- **Toggle checkboxes** — show/hide thinking blocks and tool calls

### Keyboard shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Space` / `K` | Play / Pause |
| `→` / `L` | Step forward (block) |
| `←` / `H` | Step back (block) |
| `Shift+→` / `Shift+L` | Jump to next turn |
| `Shift+←` / `Shift+H` | Jump to previous turn |
| `T` | Jump to next thinking/tool block |
| `Shift+T` | Jump to previous thinking/tool block |

## Themes

### Built-in themes

```bash
claude-replay --list-themes
```

Available themes: `tokyo-night` (default), `monokai`, `solarized-dark`, `github-light`, `dracula`, `bubbles`.

### Custom themes

Create a JSON file with CSS color values:

```json
{
  "bg": "#0d1117",
  "bg-surface": "#161b22",
  "bg-hover": "#1c2128",
  "text": "#e6edf3",
  "text-dim": "#7d8590",
  "text-bright": "#ffffff",
  "accent": "#ff7b72",
  "accent-dim": "#c9514a",
  "green": "#3fb950",
  "blue": "#58a6ff",
  "orange": "#d29922",
  "red": "#f85149",
  "cyan": "#39d2c0",
  "border": "#30363d",
  "tool-bg": "#0d1117",
  "thinking-bg": "#0b0f14"
}
```

```bash
claude-replay session.jsonl --theme-file my-theme.json -o replay.html
```

Any missing keys are filled from the `tokyo-night` defaults, so you only need to specify the colors you want to change.

For advanced customization, add an `extraCss` key with arbitrary CSS rules to override layout, fonts, or any other styles:

```json
{
  "bg": "#ffffff",
  "text": "#1c1e21",
  "extraCss": ".assistant-text { border-radius: 12px; border: 1px solid #ddd; }"
}
```

See the built-in `bubbles` theme for an example of a fully custom layout using `extraCss`.

<summary>Theme variables reference</summary>

| Variable | Used for |
|---|---|
| `bg` | Main background |
| `bg-surface` | Controls bar, elevated surfaces |
| `bg-hover` | Hover states |
| `text` | Primary text |
| `text-dim` | Secondary text, timestamps, labels |
| `text-bright` | User input, emphasized text |
| `accent` | Prompt symbol, progress bar, active states |

| `cyan` | Tool names |
| `border` | Borders and separators |
| `tool-bg` | Tool call block background |
| `thinking-bg` | Thinking block background |

</details>

## Embedding

The output is a single HTML file with no external dependencies. Embed it in blog posts or docs with an iframe:

```html
<iframe src="replay.html" width="100%" height="600" style="border: 1px solid #333; border-radius: 8px;"></iframe>
```

## How it works

1. **Parser** reads the JSONL transcript line by line, handling Claude Code's streaming format (where a single assistant message appears as multiple lines with incremental content blocks)
2. Turns are grouped as: user message + assistant response (text, tool calls, thinking blocks) + tool results
3. **Renderer** compresses the parsed turns (deflate + base64) and injects them into the HTML template
4. The **player** is vanilla JS — no frameworks, no external requests. Data is decompressed at load time using the browser-native `DecompressionStream` API

### Output optimization

Generated HTML files use two layers of optimization (zero external dependencies):

- **Minified CSS/JS** — the player template is minified with esbuild (mangled variable names, whitespace removed). Use `--no-minify` for readable output.
- **Compressed data** — transcript JSON is deflate-compressed and base64-encoded, typically reducing output size by ~60-70%. The browser decompresses it natively at load time using `DecompressionStream` (Chrome 80+, Firefox 113+, Safari 16.4+). For older browsers, use `--no-compress` to embed raw JSON.

### Development

To rebuild the minified template after editing `template/player.html`:

```bash
npm install    # installs esbuild (devDependency)
npm run build  # generates template/player.min.html
```

The minified template is built in CI and included in npm releases. Without it, the CLI falls back to the unminified template automatically.

## Secret redaction

By default, claude-replay scans all embedded text for common secret patterns and replaces them with `[REDACTED]` **before** they are written into the output HTML. This means secrets from your session (API keys, tokens, connection strings, etc.) never end up in the generated file.

Detected patterns include:
- API keys (`sk-...`, `sk-ant-...`, `key-...`)
- AWS access key IDs (`AKIA...`)
- Bearer and JWT tokens
- Database connection strings (`postgres://...`, `mongodb://...`, etc.)
- Private key blocks (`-----BEGIN ... PRIVATE KEY-----`)
- Generic key/value secrets (`api_key=...`, `auth_token: ...`)
- Environment variable secrets (`PASSWORD=...`, `TOKEN=...`)
- Long hex tokens (40+ characters)

**Important:** Pattern-based redaction is a best-effort safety net — it cannot catch every possible secret format. Always review the generated HTML before sharing publicly.

To disable redaction (e.g. for internal/private replays):

```bash
claude-replay session.jsonl --no-auto-redact -o replay.html
```

## Supported transcript formats

### Claude Code

One JSON object per line with a `type` field (`user`, `assistant`, `system`, `progress`, etc.). Includes timestamps, thinking blocks, and tool calls with results.

### Cursor

One JSON object per line with a top-level `role` field. No timestamps. Thinking appears as inline text. The format is auto-detected — no flags needed.

### Codex CLI

Event-based JSONL with typed events (`session_meta`, `response_item`, `event_msg`, etc.). Includes timestamps. Tool calls (`exec_command`, `apply_patch`) are mapped to Claude Code equivalents for consistent rendering. Codex's encrypted reasoning blocks are skipped; commentary messages are shown as thinking blocks. The format is auto-detected — no flags needed.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- Zero runtime dependencies (esbuild is a dev-only dependency for building the minified template)

## Privacy

Replay files embed the **full session transcript**, including source code, file paths, tool inputs/outputs, and thinking traces. Review the generated HTML before sharing publicly — it may contain proprietary code, internal paths, or other sensitive information. Secret redaction (enabled by default) catches common credential patterns but does not filter code or file contents.

The transcript data is stored as a compressed blob inside the HTML file. Editing the player JavaScript to hide or filter turns only affects rendering — the original data remains in the blob and can be recovered. To exclude sensitive content, use the CLI flags at generation time (e.g. `--turns`, `--exclude-turns`). Use `--redact` to strip specific strings (usernames, paths, project names) at generation time. Always review the generated replay before sharing publicly.
